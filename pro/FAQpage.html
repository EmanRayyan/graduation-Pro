	     <p class="qestion">What is a blockchain?</p>
	  	 <dir class="row">
	  		<div class="col-md-2"> <img class="imgFAQ" src="assests/img/Eman.jpg"></div>
	  		<div class="col-md-10"><p class="answersFQA">A blockchain can be thought of as a distributed database. Information held on a blockchain exists as a shared and continually reconciled database. Because of that the blockchain database isn’t stored in a single location, meaning the records it keeps are truly public and easily verifiable. No centralized version of this information exists for a hacker to corrupt. Hosted by millions of computers simultaneously, its data is accessible to anyone on the Internet.</p></div>

	     <p class="qestion">Is it secure?</p>
	  	 <dir class="row">
	  		<div class="col-md-2"> <img class="imgFAQ" src="assests/img/Eman.jpg"></div>
	  		<div class="col-md-10"><p class="answersFQA">Absolutely. Unlike regular servers where stored data can be hacked or manipulated, data in a blockchain is kept in blocks on the computers of all the network participants. So it’s impossible to hack it because to do so you would have to hack all the machines in the network. It’s also impossible to steal it because it’s encrypted.</p></div>

	  		<div class="col-md-2"> <img class="imgFAQ" src="assests/img/Eman.jpg"></div>
	  		<div class="col-md-10"><p class="answersFQA">The types of elections available include a traditional vote (majority voting) where voters choose a single candidate and a more complex method where a voter can vote for several candidates (cumulative voting). You can find out more about the vote types in the User Guide.</p></div>

	  	 <dir class="row">
	  		<div class="col-md-2"> <img class="imgFAQ" src="assests/img/Eman.jpg"></div>
	  		<div class="col-md-10"><p class="answersFQA">There are two ways of casting a vote — by unique codes and public voting. Below is a little more information about each of them. <br>
	  			<span>	UNIQUE CODES</span><br>	
	        Polys generates unique codes. Voters receive these codes in printed or some other format and vote on a public computer or their own devices. This method is suitable for a combination of online and offline voting. It is the ideal solution for political party leadership ballots and electing the governments of cities, regions or countries.

	        <span>PUBLIC VOTE	</span> <br>	
	        A public vote has a special link and QR code, and is open to everyone who can view it. This method is suitable for voting at public conferences, meetings, and other public events.</p></div>

	  	 <dir class="row">
	  		<div class="col-md-2"> <img class="imgFAQ" src="assests/img/Eman.jpg"></div>
	  		<div class="col-md-10"><p class="answersFQA">When voting is under way, nothing can be changed. This is one of the advantages of blockchain technology, which excludes the manipulation of results after voters have already started voting. If it was a critical mistake, you will have to hold a new vote.</p></div>
